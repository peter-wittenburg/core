# C2CAMP

Cross-Continental Collection Access & Management Pilot (C2CAMP)

C2CAMP is a global collaboration and platform from 5 different continents proposes building a a flexible and extendable testbed focused on a global virtualization layer of Digital Objects and thus developing a basic layer of the evolving eco-system of data infrastructures. It includes currently 20 interested institutes including scientific communities engaged in Research Infrastructure Building, large data and HPC centers, IT centers and infrastructure service providers. It is open to include more engaged partners. Currently, C2CAMP is working on a document that describes different types of engagement. Of greatest relevance is active participation in developing running code of components that can play a role in the evolving domain of registered Digital Objects.

The C2CAMP platform is organising regular meetings (mostly in form of virtual meetings) to advance the plans. Some partners already started to develop code. RDA (http://rd-alliance.org) is used to advance specifications of components and their interfaces. C2CAMP is an implementation network in the GO FAIR initiative to synchronise their work with other developers working on FAIR compliant infrastructure and services. 

The C2CAMP group and its members produced a number of documents which describe the intentions in detail:
- Basic C2CAMP Sketch: http://doi.org/10.23728/b2share.aea2808e8fd141a8a6d2e2547a0d8693 
- C2CAMP Concept and Approach: http://doi.org/10.23728/b2share.ecfa8f0b4f584c6795817bb433d2dcea

More detailed documents and specifications are being developed by the C2CAMP collaboration, but are only accessible to the members.
